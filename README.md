Fraud Detection using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm

Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning algorithm where the it is trained using supervised learning algorithm, Logistic Regression.
This is a Dataset where this will disclose the attributes that are mentioned in the Fraud_Detection_Dictionary csv file, where in that each and every attribute is mentioned with what it has done. The target attribute is isFraud Varable. The isFraud is the transactions made by the fraudulent agents inside the simulation. In this specific dataset the fraudulent behavior of the agents aims to profit by taking control or customers accounts and try to empty the funds by transferring to another account and then cashing out of the system.
The main aim of the Fraud Detection is to identify or train the machine by detecting the fraud using supervised learning algorithm, Linear Regression.
